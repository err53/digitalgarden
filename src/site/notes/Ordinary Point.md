Given a [[Second Order homogenous Linear Differential Equation\|Second Order homogenous Linear Differential Equation]]
$$
a_2(x)y'' + a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = 0 \quad \circledast
$$
rewritten in standard form as
$$
y'' + P(x) y' + Q(x) y = 0
$$

$x_0$ is an **ordinary point** of $\circledast$ if $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are both analytic at $x_0$
