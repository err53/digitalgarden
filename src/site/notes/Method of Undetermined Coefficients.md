Used to find particular solution to non-homogenous, linear, constant coefficient ODE $L[y] = g(x)$ when $g(x)$ is linear combination of functions of the form

$$
(polynomial)(e^{\alpha x} \cos(\beta x)) \textnormal{ and/or }
(polynomial)(e^{\gamma x} \sin(\delta x))
$$

where $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$ are real numbers.

If $g(x)$ is a polynomial, then $\alpha = \beta = \gamma = \delta = 0$.
If $g(x) = (polynomial)e^{\alpha x}$, then $\beta = \gamma = \delta = 0, \alpha \neq 0$
If $g(x) = (polynomial)e^{\alpha x} \cos(\beta x)) + (polynomial)(e^{\gamma x} \sin(\delta x)), \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta \neq 0$
