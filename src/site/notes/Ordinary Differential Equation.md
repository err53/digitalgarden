# Ordinary Differential Equations

An equation that contains an unknown **function** of one variable and one or more of its derivatives.

Contrast with [[Partial Differential Equation\|Partial Differential Equation]]

Eg, let $y = f(x)$

Then $y'' + y' + 2y = 2x$ is a second order differential equation

Alternatively,
$$
m \frac{d^2u}{dt^2} = F(t, u, u')
$$
where $u$, $u'$, and $u''$ are position, velocity, acceleration at time $t$, $m$ is the mass, $F$ is force acting on object.

In this equation, [[Independent Variable\|Independent Variable]] is time $t$, and [[Dependent Variable\|Dependent Variable]] is $u$.
