Theorem:

Given an ODE in the form of $M(x, y) dx + N(x y) dy = 0$

If $\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$ are constants in x and y on an open set S,
then this ODE is ==exact on S== iff $\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$

$$
dF = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} dx + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} dy
$$
with the goal to find such an $F$
