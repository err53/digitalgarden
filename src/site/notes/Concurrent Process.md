Composition of sequential [[Process (automata)\|processes]]

==Hidden Assumption:== concurrent systems can be decomposed into sequential systems


1. [[Process (automata)\|Process (automata)]]
2. Model of a process: [[Finite State Machine\|Finite State Machine]]
3. A possible implementation of processes: Java Threads


Two common models:
[[Finite State Processes\|Finite State Processes]]
[[Labelled Transition Systems\|Labelled Transition Systems]]
