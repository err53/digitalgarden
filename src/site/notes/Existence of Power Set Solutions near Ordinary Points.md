If $x_0$ is an ordinary point of the [[Differential Equation\|Differential Equation]]
$$
a_2(x) y'' + a_1(x) y' + a_0(x)y = 0 \quad \circledast
$$
then $\circledast$ has two linearly independent solutions $y_1(x)$ and $y_2(x)$ that are both analytic at $x_0$:

$$
y_1(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n(x - x_0)^n,
\quad
y_2(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x - x_0)^n
$$
and each solution has radius of convergence $R$, where $R$ is the distance to the nearest singular point to $x_0$ in the complex plane.
