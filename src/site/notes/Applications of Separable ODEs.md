# Applications of Separable ODEs

## Orthogonal Trajectories
1. Take derivative of entire equation
2. Isolate for $dy/dx$
3. Translate into new slope ($y'_{new} = -\frac{1}{y'_{old}}$)
4. Solve for y

## Mixing Problems
$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = (\text{rate in}) - (\text{rate out})
$$
Generally $y$ represents the amount of stuff in the liquid, with the rate in as a constant, and the rate out in a form of $\text{flow rate} \cdot y / \text{initial amount of liquid}$

## Newton's law for cooling

$T_s:$ temperature of the surrounding environment
$T(t):$ temperature at time $t$
Rate of cooling:
$$
\frac{dT}{dt} = k (T - T_s),\ k < 0
$$
