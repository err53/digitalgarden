- Generally referring to large quantities of information
- Companies are collecting and processing more data today than ever before
- Data must contain information, and mean something (it is subjective)
	- Therefore, we need **structured data**
- Types of structure
	- Graph data
		- Eg RDF (Relational Data Format)
		- There can be loops
	- Hierarchical Data - Trees
		- Eg XML, JSON
		- Strictly child-parent, no loops
	- Structured plain-text data
		- Eg CSV (comma-separated values)
		- Very basic table representation
- Challenges with Data:
	- How to get information from data
	- How to update data
	- How to keep data consistent
	- How to deal with huge amounts of data
	- How to deal with [[MOCs/Concurrency MOC\|concurrent]] access to data
