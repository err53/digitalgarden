## Radius of Convergence
Represented as either a nonnegative real number or $\infty$ such that the series converges if $|x - a| < r$, and diverges if $|x - a| > r$. At $|x - a| = r$, the series may or may not converge.

Thus,
$$
\begin{align}
a - r < x < a + r &\hspace{2em} \text{power series converges} \\
x < a - r\ \operatorname{and}\ x > a + r &\hspace{2em} \text{power series diverges}
\end{align}
$$

## Alt Definition
In other words, given a power series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (x - x_0)^n$ centred at $x_0$, there exists a number R with $0 \leq R \leq \infty$ called the radius of convergence.
- The series converges absolutely if $|x - x_0| < R$
- The series diverges if $|x - x_0| > R$
