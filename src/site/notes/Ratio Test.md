# Ratio Test
Consider series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$  and $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{|a_{n+1}|}{|a_n|} = L$

1) If $L < 1$, series is absolutely convergent
2) If $L > 1$, then the series is divergent (For the original series)
3) If $L = 1$, then inconclusive

```ad-note
If the series behaves like a [[P-Series]], don't bother with the ratio test! It will be inconclusive.

This test is particularly useful for series that include [[Factorial|factorials]]
```
