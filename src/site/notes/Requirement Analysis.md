# Requirement Analysis
- SRS
	- Contract bt client & devs
	- What's in scope and out-of-scope
- Functional Requirements
	- Things software does
	- "This software shall..."
	- Atomic, precise, verifiable
	- eg:
		- The software shall display weather information for the next seven days
			- This is too vague! What's the location? What do you mean by weather?
		- Reqs are hard, waterfall is idealized
- Non-functional Requirements
	- Usability, performance
